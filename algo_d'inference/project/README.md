# Automatic-Typos-Correction-with-HMM
This is a project of the course of Algorithms of inference. The context is in the edition of words and articles. I have used 1-order HMM
and 2-order HMM for correcting typos errors automatically. For the test set including 10% errors letters, the 1-order HMM could decrease 
the error rate(in the level of letters) to 6.8%.
